            (<i>Astroparticle, Particle and Cosmology</i>) laboratory in Paris in the Cosmology department. I was able to work with Jean-Christophe Hamilton's team

          <h2> Introduction </h2>

          <p>Contemporary cosmology attempts to trace the history of the universe from our time to the most primordial moments. The theories available today
          Today's theories describe a universe that becomes hotter and denser as we go back in time. These theories fail to describe the physics of our universe in its earliest days.
          of our universe in its earliest moments because it is necessary to combine general relativity and quantum mechanics. This theory is still unknown to us.
          unknown to us, however it is possible to test our hypotheses before Planck time which corresponds to <span> `t_(text{Planck}) &#8776; 10^(-44)` </span> s after the supposed initial instant.

          <br/><br/>

          Our theories predict some phenomena that have already been experimentally verified such as the expansion of the universe, the cosmic microwave background
          but also other phenomena such as cosmological inflation which is a very large expansion of the universe in a very short time. This
          would have expanded by a factor <span> `10^(26)` </span> in a time of the order of <span> `10^(-36)` </span> s to <span> `10^(-33)` </span> s. In particular, this theory of cosmic inflation allows us to propose
          a solution to the flatness problem which shows us that it is difficult to explain theoretically the weak curvature of the universe as a whole.
          Inflation also allows us to propose a solution to the horizon problem, which shows us that certain areas of our universe seem particularly
          similar even though they have not had time to exchange any information. Inflation may at first sight escape our understanding but it is a theory with many virtues
          a theory with many virtues and which, if validated, would take us one step closer to understanding our universe and its beginnings.

          <br/><br/>

          As the history of our universe unfolds, the universe, which is dense and hot, becomes increasingly cold and transparent.
          At 380,000 years after the supposed Big Bang, the first light from the universe to be emitted, which is now called the Cosmic Microwave Background (CMB), contains more and more light.

          the polarisation of this radiation, which contains scalar and tensor perturbations known as E and B modes. The QUBIC experiment
          experiment proposes to measure the B-modes of the cosmic microwave background polarisation using an innovative technique called bolometric interferometry.
          This technique combines the advantage of interferometry, which is the control of instrumental systematics, with bolometers, which provide
          a better sensitivity. Since B-modes are a very weak signal, it is necessary to design an extremely precise instrument whose characteristics are very well known in order to limit the risk of errors.
          The B-modes are a very weak signal, it is necessary to think of an extremely precise instrument and whose characteristics are very well known in order to limit the systematics and other undesirable effects.

          <br/><br/>

          A new problem now arises for the measurement of the B-modes of the CMB polarisation. Some calculations show that there may be leakage from the E-modes to the B-modes, which is a problem for the CMB.

          the Milky Way. A first attempt was made between 2010 and 2012 with the BICEP mission, which published in the journal Nature the first observation of
          primordial gravitational waves (or B-modes). The following year, a correction was published explaining that the signal actually seen by BICEP was
          the polarisation generated by the astrophysical foregrounds of our Milky Way. This mission teaches us that in the study of the CMB and more

          <p>To correct this effect, we will have to implement an astrophysical component separation algorithm, which thanks to the QUBIC maps will be able to
          provide us with CMB maps "purified" from other components such as the thermal emission due to galactic dust in a first step. In a

          allows us to ensure that the signal received does indeed come from the source that interests us here, the cosmic microwave background. To do this, we will use
          the package <i>FG-Buster</i> whose operation will be explained in the third part but which is a parametric method of separation of
          astrophysical components. One of the main issues of this internship and of a possible thesis afterwards will be to apply this method of component separation and to adapt it to the

          <h2> Some theoretical elements... </h2>

              <br/>

              <h3> Inflation</h3>

                <p>The inflation model solves many problems in cosmology, including the flatness problem, and helps explain why
                our universe is essentially homogeneous. This inflation theory predicts an exponential expansion in the size of our universe allowing
                the transition from a quantum universe consisting of a soup of elementary particles and where all the fundamental interactions are
                to a classical universe.

                <br/><br/>

                This theory was introduced in an attempt to solve two important problems in cosmology, the flatness problem and the horizon problem.
                The flatness problem is the difficulty our theories have in describing the very low curvature of our universe on very large scales. This
                This flatness comes from the fact that the visible part of our universe is very small compared to the whole universe. An analogy can be made with the Earth
                which appears flat to us on our scale on the ground, but if we step back, it does have a non-zero curvature. This flatness effect
                is only an illusion for us and our instruments. The second problem is the horizon problem, which shows that some areas of space
                have extremely close physical quantities while knowing that they could not exchange information. In the next section, we will present
                the cosmic microwave background in more detail, but it tells us that the deep universe radiates like a black body of about 3 Kelvin. This background
                background has anisotropies of the order of <span> `10^(-5) text{K}` </span> but how can two places in the universe that have not been able to exchange
                information can have the same temperature?

                <br/><br/>

                To solve these fundamental problems, we turn to the theory of inflation, which tells us that for a fraction of a second, the universe has expanded by an immense factor.
                expanded by an immense factor. To solve the cosmological problems, this inflation must have expanded our universe much faster than the speed of
                To solve the cosmological problems, this inflation had to expand our universe much faster than the speed of light, which allowed contact in the past between two regions that for us today could not communicate with each other. Inflation may be
                inflation may escape our intuition but it allows us to resolve conflicts as well as to explain certain observations, one of which is the cosmic microwave background.
                cosmological background.<p/>

              <h3>The cosmological diffuse background and its polarization</h3>

                <p>The theoretical framework in which we now place ourselves is an expanding universe filled with a primordial plasma. This plasma consists of a soup of
                elementary particles (protons, electrons, photons,...) and in very strong interaction with each other. At that time, the primordial fluid
                At that time, the ionised primordial fluid prevents the photons from moving freely, their mean free path is then very weak which makes this plasma opaque to the radiation.
                The universe then dilutes, its temperature and density decreases which allows at a time, the atomic nuclei to capture the free electrons, creating
                thus creating the first atoms. This moment is known as recombination, the atoms interact very little with the photons, the universe then becomes brutally transparent, it is the emission of light.
                This is the emission of the first light of the universe: the cosmic microwave background.

                <br/><br/>

                The last scattering surface is the surface where the fossil radiation was emitted, i.e. at 380 000 years after instant zero. This surface
                draws a sphere of 13.7 billion light years around the observer. It designates a region of space causally related to the observer,
                i.e. where the radius of this sphere is the maximum distance between two objects that could exchange information, in this case photons. This surface
                acts as an optical wall to observations, it is the furthest image that can be obtained of our universe using
                electromagnetic information. To go further in the observations, it will therefore be necessary to use another information mediator such as neutrinos or gravitational waves.
                neutrinos or gravitational waves. When the first photons are emitted at the last scattering surface, the
                radiation follows a black body law defined by

                <br/><br/>

                <div class="cmath" align="center"> `B_(nu) (T) = (2 h nu^3)/(c^2) (1)/(e^((h nu)/(k T)) - 1)` </div>

                <br/><br/>

                <p>where h is Planck's constant, ν is the frequency of the radiation, k is Boltzmann's constant and T is the temperature of the body. Fossil radiation therefore follows
                this law with a homogeneous temperature in all directions of the order of T ∼ 3000 K and <span> `Delta T&#x2044; T &#8776; 10^(-5)` </span> .
                As this radiation reaches us in all directions, the universe continues to expand which, through the Doppler effect causes a shift towards
                red shift of the radiation of the order of <span> `z &#8776; 1000` </span>. The signal that reaches us therefore no longer comes from a black body at 3000 K.
                Today, this radiation therefore corresponds to the thermal emission of a body of the order of 3 K. It has been measured more precisely thanks to the
                WMAP (Wilkinson Microwave Anisotropy Probe) satellite and then by the Planck satellite and thus corresponds to the emission of a black body of temperature
                <span> `T_0 &#8776; 2.725 ± 0.003 K` </span>.</p>

              <h3> Temperature anisotropies </h3>

                <p>Previous missions show that it is easier to make a differential measurement of the background temperature rather than an absolute measurement
                of this temperature. We will note <span> `Delta T` </span> the temperature difference from the mean temperature defined above. We can describe the information
                related to the density fluctuations of the cosmic microwave background can be described by looking at two points on two lines of sight <span> `vec(n)_1` </span> and
                <span> `vec(n)_2` </span> forming an angle such that <span> `cos(theta) = vec(n)_1 . vec(n)_2` </span>, we therefore define a two-point correlation function
                points such that:</p>

                <br/><br/>

                <div class="cmath" align="center"> `C(vec(n)_1, vec(n)_2) = < Delta T(vec(n)_1) Delta T(vec(n)_2) >` </div>

                <h3> The E and B fields </h3>

                  <p>The stokes parameters I, Q and U are very convenient quantities to use to characterise the electromagnetic field. However, they have
                  a disadvantage in our situation, the parameters Q and U both describe the linear polarisation of the field as one is simply a
                  rotation of the other, making them dependent on the orientation of the observer.</p>

                  <div class="im_center" style="--w: 30%; --h: 15%;"> <img src="Picture/EBfields.png"> </div>

                  <br/>

                  Similarly, it is possible to define E and B fields through spherical harmonics such as :

                  <br/><br/><br/>

                  <div align="center">
                    `E(vec(n)) = &sum; &sum; a_(lm)^E Y_(lm) (vec(n))`
                  </div>
                  <div align="center">
                    `B(vec(n)) = &sum; &sum; a_(lm)^B Y_(lm) (vec(n))`
                  </div>

                  <br/> <br/>

                  <p>As the CMB is weakly polarized (about 10%), these signals are quite weak in front of the intensity parameter I. These fields are therefore now
                  independent of the observer's position and allow the construction of a whole scalar field. The E-field is characterised as a scalar field
                  (rotationally invariant). It allows the generation of Q polarization only, unlike the B field which allows the generation of both Q and U
                  This difference will be a problem called B-mode leakage. Indeed, scalar perturbations generate the E-field only, whereas tensorial perturbations (gravitational waves) generate the U-field only.
                  This effect makes the detection of B-modes difficult. This effect makes the detection of B-modes even more
                  This effect makes the detection of B-modes even more difficult, even though the signal is already extremely weak. <p>

            <h2> Astrophysical foregrounds </h2>

                  <p>In experiments related to the study of the CMB, the foregrounds play the role of major limitations. The very faint signals that one seeks to measure
                  are very often at best polluted or even completely hidden by the emissions from the astrophysical foregrounds. We can mention for example
                  free-free emission or braking radiation. The theory of electromagnetism teaches us that any variation in speed of a charged particle
                  produces radiation. Here, the free electrons are braked by the galactic gas and therefore produce radiation that must be taken into account for the
                  of the CMB. In our study, the main source we will deal with is the galactic dust in the Milky Way.</p>

                <p>The QUBIC instrument works on the principle of bolometric interferometry, it will combine these two tools to take advantage of the benefits of each. In particular, this method makes it possible to take advantage of
                the very high sensitivity of bolometers cooled to very low temperatures and the very good control of systematic effects by interferometry. These numerous advantages could be
                These numerous advantages could be decisive since it is known that there is a mixing of the Stokes parameters Q and U, and subsequently leakage from the E modes to the B modes. This is a more complex operation, but one that will make it possible to
                This is a more complex operation but one that will allow us to overcome some of the limitations of conventional imagers.
                <br/><br/>
                The interferometric nature of QUBIC requires us to add a calibration step. This consists, from an antenna that sends signals with different phases, in the correction of these phases by the instrument so that all the signals are in the same phase.
                by the instrument so that all the signals can be processed together. A study phase was carried out by collaboration 1 and continues today, in order to calculate the correction coefficients. We
                This step is called 'self-calibration'. The QUBIC instrument is today the only instrument that has the objective of studying the B modes of the CMB polarisation and that has
                this key step of self-calibration. This gives it a clear advantage in the control of systematic effects and thus in the race for B-modes.<p/>

                <h3> Comparison with a conventional imager </h3>

                  <p>The QUBIC instrument operates on a completely different principle to a conventional imager. It combines interferometry with signal measurement by bolometers cooled to very low temperatures
                  (about 300 mK) for better accuracy. This combination allows the advantages of both techniques to be combined in order to obtain a finer measurement with less systematics.</p>

                  <p>For example, QUBIC scans the sky through its synthetic lobe and thus allows us to see the sky differently from a conventional telescope. Figure 3.4 shows us a two-dimensional slice of this synthetic lobe.
                  Unlike a conventional imager, the QUBIC lobe has several peaks and the position of these peaks depends directly on the frequency. Physically, the instrument will observe different parts of the sky at
                  different frequencies. This is one of the foundations of spectro-imaging, which is one of the strengths of the QUBIC instrument, and allows the creation of maps at different sub-frequencies in the 150 and
                  220 GHz bands. This approach will eventually allow better management of the foregrounds that are so troublesome in the study of the CMB. In addition, this synthetic lobe allows to see the angular correlations of the sky, which will facilitate
                  This will greatly facilitate the estimation of the power spectra of the temperature and polarisation anisotropies of the cosmic microwave background.

                  <br/><br/>

                  In addition, interferometry is known to have good control over systematic effects, i.e. measurement errors related to the instrument itself. Besides the development of the instrument,
                  the QUBIC collaboration is focusing on 'self-calibration', which aims to calibrate the instrument as accurately as possible. The term 'self' means that the detector has no information about the source
                  the source, which makes the technique innovative. The instrument is the only experiment aiming at finding B-modes and having this self-calibration step. As the electromagnetic wave passes through the horn array
                  (acting as interference slits), an interference pattern will be formed. By opening equivalent pairs of horns in turn, a specific pattern can be observed which must be
                  the same for different pairs. Small imperfections can hide in the interference patterns and are necessarily due to the systematic effects of the instrument. This method makes it possible to
                  This method allows to quantify them and to treat the synthetic lobe accordingly. This is a very strong method of correcting for systematic effects that is directly related to the interferometric nature of the instrument, which would be impossible with a conventional imager.

          <h2> Separation of components </h2>

              <br/>

              <p>Here we are interested in the component separation problem using the FG-Buster algorithm, but before we look at the results we can produce, it may be interesting
              to see the map-making problem. To do this, we define the signal we receive in each pixel as:</p>

              <br/><br/>

              <div class="cmath" align="center"> `vec(d)_p = A_p(vec(beta)).vec(s)_p + vec(n)_p` </div>

              <br/><br/>

              <p>where <span> `vec(d)` </span> is the signal we receive from the instrument (or TOD: Time Ordered Data in the case of QUBIC), <span> `A(vec(beta))` </span> is the
              mixing matrix parameterised by the unknown parameters <span> `vec(beta)` </span> to be estimated. Finally, the vector <span> `vec(n)` </span> represents the noise on our map.
              The problem is summarised in Appendix A and allows us to see the difficulty of the data processing as well as the map-making step. The above equation can be represented as
              the following way:</p>

              <br/><br/>

              <div class="cmath" align="center"> `((d_(text(pixel 1))),
                                                   (d_(text(pixel 2))),
                                                   (...),
                                                   (d_(text(pixel N)))) =

                                                     ((A_1^(text(CMB)), A_1^(text(DUST))),
                                                      (A_2^(text(CMB)), A_2^(text(DUST))),
                                                      (..., ... ),
                                                      (A_N^(text(CMB)), A_N^(text(DUST)))) .

                                                      ((s_(text(pixel 1))^(text(CMB)), ..., s_(text(pixel N))^(text(CMB))),
                                                      (s_(text(pixel 1))^(text(DUST)), ..., s_(text(pixel N))^(text(DUST)))) +

                                                      ((n_(text(pixel 1))), (n_(text(pixel 2))), (...), (n_(text(pixel N))))` </div>

              <br/><br/>

              <p>In Appendix A, we made the likelihood development used by FG-Buster into which we could inject the signal expression <span> `vec(s)`</span>. This
              operation allows us to define (see the development in Appendix A) the spectral likelihood function such that:</p>

              <div class="cmath" align="center"> `-2 log mathcal{L}_(text(spec)) (beta) = K + (A^t N^(-1) vec(d))^t (A^t N^(-1) A)^(-1) (A^t N^(-1) vec(d))` </div>

              <p>This expression depends only on the spectral indices that we are trying to estimate here. We will therefore try to find the value of β (there may be several) that minimises this likelihood function.
              Once these spectral indices have been estimated, we can create the dust and CMB maps separately. In our case, it is assumed that dust is defined by a grey body relation at a
              temperature <span> `T` </span>, a frequency <span> `nu` </span> and possessing a spectral index <span> `beta_d` </span>. This relationship is of the form:</p>

              <div class="cmath" align="center"> `s_d(nu) = A_d (nu)/(e^((h nu)/(k T)) - 1) (e^((h nu_0)/(k T)) - 1)/(nu_0) (nu/nu_0)^(beta_d)` </div>

          <h3> Separation in a simple case: without noise </h3>

                We can start applying this algorithm to the maps generated by the QUBIC instrument. We will place ourselves in the case of 5 subbands whose frequencies and angular resolutions are summarized in the table below:

                <p>Here we place ourselves in a simple case in order to apprehend the separation of components with FG-Buster. We therefore consider that our cards have a CMB signal as well as a dust signal that we will want to
                to separate. This separation will be done on 5 sub-bands and for a reference frequency <span> `nu_(150)` </span> = 150 GHz and <span> `nu_(220)` </span> = 220 GHz. Table 4.1 shows us that our maps are at 00 different resolutions, which
                This should be taken into account after discussion with the authors of the method. The addition of a setting function at the same resolution was one of the decisive steps. We therefore smooth our maps with a
                Gaussian kernel to degrade our maps to the worst resolution of each band.</p>.

                <div class="im_center" style="--w: 40%; --h: 20%;"> <img src="Picture/inputs.png"> </div>

                <p> The input maps of the algorithm form an array of size (nfreq,nstokes,npix). We use maps in the healpix format which have a parameter NSIDE = 256, i.e. a pixelation of the order of
                <span> `1.597 times 10^(-5) text( deg)^2` </span>.

                <br/>

                The figure below shows the first results of an astrophysical component separation in the QUBIC experiment. Here we have very simplified inputs compared to the final maps but the choice was made to proceed step by step
                made to proceed step by step by making the code more complex as we go along. </p>

                <div class="im_center" style="--w: 50%; --h: 25%"> <img src="Picture/separe_1.png"> </div>

                <p>You can see from the residual maps for CMB and dust which is simply the difference between the theoretical map and the estimated map that the reconstruction is very good. By making several
                realisations of this separation, we can have a histogram of the estimates of the <span> `beta_d` </span> parameter. We start by doing a Monte Carlo on the estimation of βd for simple PySM maps and then on
                QUBIC maps with a band integration option enabled. This integration may have an influence on the estimation of the parameters, so it may be interesting to see how the algorithm behaves
                the algorithm behaves in the presence of band integration which is a particularity of QUBIC.</p>

                <p>From the figures above we can see that the estimation is overall quite good for both cases. The figure on the left shows us that the estimate of the <span> `beta_d` </span> parameter is very
                good in the case where we have no integration on the bands. This is a first conclusive test of how the FG-Buster algorithm works. We have here a first separation of components
                in an extremely simplified case.

                <br/><br/>

                In order to have a model a little closer to reality, we now activate the integration on the bands. The map generation algorithm will therefore create several maps within the same band,
                and then integrate them on the frequencies. This operation averages out these realisations in a way. The figure on the right shows us the estimated parameter for the 150 GHz band, the 220 GHz band and the combination of the two.
                the combination of the two. It can be seen that the estimate is quite good in the case of the 150 GHz band, but that there is a bias for the 220 GHz band, which is therefore also reflected in the combination of the two.
                The integration creates maps that are slightly different from the previous ones, so it is not absurd to have a bias on the estimation of the parameters. However, the estimate is still quite close to the expected value, even if this effect must be taken into account.
                the expected value even if this effect should be studied to be able to correct it later.</p> <p>


                  <h3> Separation in the presence of white and uniform noise </h3>

                        <p>Now that we have seen that our algorithm works for a simple case with no noise, we can make our model slightly more complex by adding uniform noise to start with. When the instrument is
                        functional and takes its first data, the noise level will correspond to 3 years of acquisition. An argument in the map generation function allows us to manage this noise level. A major advantage of the
                        of the FG-Buster function we use is that it itself estimates the noise correlation matrix <span> `N = < n cdot n^t >` </span>. The technique we use is to calculate the RMS (for Root Mean Square
                        ) of the noise maps in order to quantify the effect.</p>.

                        <div class="im_right" style="--w: 50%; --h: 25%; --r: 0%"> <img src="Picture/noise_separe_dust.png"> </div>

                        <p>The figures above show us the maps purified by FG-Buster in a noisy case. We can see that the reconstruction of both components is very good (we have an estimate of <span> `beta_d approx 1.539` </span>
                        in this case). The intensity I is very well reconstructed, the parameters Q and U showing the linear polarisation is quite well reconstructed despite some imperfections at small scales. We have here a case of
                        functional component separation for white noise at the same level as that of the QUBIC instrument. It may be interesting to see the distribution of the reconstructions of the spectral parameters for several
                        separation realisations. </p>

                        <p>The figure below shows us the estimation of the βd parameter for 200 different realisations with a white noise level corresponding to 3 years of data acquisition. In the majority of cases, for the band at 150 and
                        220 GHz band, the spectral index is rather well reconstructed. However, a large variance is observed in the case of the 150 GHz band and on the contrary, the combination of the two bands reduces this
                        variance on the reconstruction of βd. This combination makes the algorithm more robust to the noise that can be put in the map, as these two bands are quite far apart and therefore allow a greater leverage on the estimation.
                        on the estimation. This advantage allows us to give more information to FG-Buster than if the two bands were closer, so we have a better calculation of the likelihood function which leads to a better estimation of the parameters.

                  <h3> Calculation of the angular power spectra </h3>

                  <p>Previously, we have seen that the reconstruction of the spectral parameter βd is done rather well when we combine the two bands of the QUBIC instrument. This good reconstruction shows us that
                  the component separation is functional, so we have CMB and dust maps and can now calculate the angular power spectra. In the QUBIC studies, the spectra are
                  In the QUBIC studies, the spectra are calculated under the assumption that no foregrounds are present (although this is known to be false). It is therefore now possible to calculate these spectra while being certain that the foregrounds no longer play a role.
                  no longer play any role.</p>

                  <div class="im_center" style="--w: 50%; --h: 25%"> <img src="Picture/ps_est.png"> </div>

                  <p>It is now possible to run Monte Carlo simulations by generating maps, applying component separation and then calculating the angular power spectra. The upper figure shows us these results.
                  The upper figure shows these results, the black curve corresponds to a typical CMB spectrum model. The red dots correspond to the estimation of the power spectrum from a map containing CMB and dust, which has been purified by the
                  dust, which has been purified by FG-Buster. This first figure shows the estimation of the spectra in a noise-free case. During the separation, the spectral parameters were rather well estimated staying
                  around 1.54. This allows us to ensure that our CMB maps are no longer polluted by Galactic dust. There is a very good agreement between the spectrum estimate for our purified maps
                  with the model considered. </p>

                  <div class="im_center" style="--w: 50%; --h: 25%"> <img src="Picture/all_comp_ps.png"> </div>

                  <p>Spectra can therefore be constructed for each of the separate components. Here we have zoomed in on the BB coefficient seen earlier and on which we have displayed in black the CMB, dust
                  as well as our input maps. The green and blue dots represent the estimated power spectrum of our purified CMB and dust maps respectively. The green and blue dots represent the estimated power spectrum of our purified CMB and dust maps respectively.
                  The green and blue dots represent the power spectrum estimates of our CMB and purified dust maps respectively, and the spectra of maps consisting of only the component in question are shown as solid lines on top. It can be seen that the estimation of the spectra is in very good agreement with the models. We recall here that dust can be modelled
                  as a power law of the form <span> `beta &#x2113;^(-alpha)` </span> where <span> `alpha` </span> and <span> `beta` </span> are two free parameters that can be estimated.</p>

                  <div class="im_center" style="--w: 50%; --h: 25%"> <img src="Picture/ps_noisy.png"> </div>

                  <p>We can apply the same method by adding noise to our initial maps. This addition deteriorates the estimation of the spectral parameters. To correct this effect, we will use the combination of the two bands
                  of the QUBIC instrument. The figure above shows us the results, as expected, when only one band is used, the estimated power spectra do not quite fit the model. In
                  On the other hand, the combination of the two allows us to have a certain leverage which clearly improves the separation. We bring much more information to the algorithm, which thus proceeds to a better
                  We are now able to estimate its likelihood function.

            <h2> Conclusion </h2>

            <p>This internship allowed me to look at fundamental physics issues but also at an instrumental side which is also important. The missions of maintenance and finalization of the construction of the instrument
            allowed me to better understand its very particular functioning. These particularities make its analysis rather difficult but will certainly allow to cross a wall that some classical telescopes will be
            unable to cross. I was also able to take part in the packing and the preparation of the sending of the instrument (May 19, 2021) for its final destination which is Argentina in the area of San Antonio de los Cobres.
            This shipment is a step towards the first data collection of the instrument and thus towards the search for the B-modes of the cosmic microwave background.

            During these 5 months of internship in the QUBIC collaboration at the APC laboratory, I was able to learn about primordial cosmology as well as the physics of the cosmic microwave background. This allowed me to understand in depth
            the problem that the instrument seeks to answer. The search for the B-modes of the polarisation of the cosmic microwave background is a very difficult quest, and for me it will be one of the next great discoveries
            in cosmology.

            <br/><br/>

            This internship has given me a very thorough introduction to bolometric interferometry, and has also allowed me to understand the issues related to the instrument and the data analysis. For example, before
            For example, before attempting to implement a component separation method, I had to learn about QUBIC-related methods. Over the years, the collaboration has developed a set of Python code for data analysis,
            self-calibration,... The first few weeks of my internship consisted of learning how to manage its specific functions, whether in map generation, power spectra calculation or others.

            <br/><br/>

            Then, I started to get interested in component separation methods, in particular the FG-Buster algorithm developed by Josquin Errard and Radek Stompor at the Astroparticle and Cosmology laboratory in Paris.
            This parametric component separation method attempts to estimate the free spectral parameters which in our case are simply the spectral index of the dust. In our third part, we have presented the general
            the general method employed, as well as a first simple approach without noise. We have seen that this method works well in this simplified case. We were then able to make our model slightly more complex by adding a level of
            noise level corresponding to that of QUBIC. This addition led to modifications within the algorithm so that we could estimate this noise level for each map. The results of the separation in the presence of
            The results of the separation in the presence of white noise are visible and show that quite good results are obtained. Furthermore, one of the advantages of the instrument is that it has two separate bands, which allows us to combine them, and thus to provide more information to constrain the parameters.
            information to constrain the spectral parameters.

            <br/><br/>

            Once the separation method was functional for a certain card model, we could calculate the angular power spectra corresponding to the coefficients TT, EE, BB and TE. These spectra allow us to
            verify the correct estimation of our CMB and dust maps. The estimates of these spectra show us that the combination of the two QUBIC bands again provides a better reconstruction
            than using a single band. At the time of writing, I am taking into account the non-uniform noise of the instrument. Due to the scanning strategy of the instrument on the sky, we spend more time
            Due to the scanning strategy of the instrument over the sky, we spend more time in the centre of the maps than at the edges, so we have a more intense noise level at the edges of the map. This non-uniformity has to be taken into account and this is what I am
            I'm doing now.

            <br/><br/>

            To put the work in perspective, we have applied a method of separating astrophysical components in a noise-free case and then in the white noise case. On the other hand, we know that
            due to the interferometric nature and the spectro-imaging step, the maps generated by the instrument have correlations between the stokes parameters and the sub-bands (Appendix D). These correlations must
            be taken into account in the algorithm in order to have an optimal separation. These correlation matrices should then appear in the calculation of the likelihood function. This modification step is an important step that requires
